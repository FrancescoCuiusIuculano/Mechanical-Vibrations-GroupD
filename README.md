# Mechanical Vibrations
This repository contains the projects developed during the 1st semester of academic year 2020-2021 at [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/), for the class "Mechanical Vibrations" held by professors [Francesco Pellicano](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/frank) and [Antonio Zippo](http://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/antoniozippo)

## Group D
All the projects have been developed as a team work. The team was composed as follows:
- Chairman: [Edoardo dâ€™Amicis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edoardo-d-amicis-b2a9471b1/)
- Coordinator: Giovanni Coppola
- Technical tasks:
  - Theoretical developments
    - [Giacomo Chinni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomo-chinni-b514a419a/)
    - [Marco Cunaccia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcocun/)
    - [Giacomo Davanzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomo-davanzo-bb09881b7/)
  - Numerical Implementation
    - [Juan Sebastian Cepeda Munevar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-cep95/)
    - [Francesco Cuius Iuculano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-cuius-iuculano-19bb66189/)
    - [Denis Tonini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-tonini/)

## The projects
Each project is focused on a particular task related to the analysis of vibrations:
1. 1 degree of freedom systems
1. N degrees of freedom systems
1. Continuous systems

Each folder contains:
- The assigned tasks for each project
- A collection of the Matlab scripts used to fulfill the tasks
- A report describing the theoretical developments and the subsequent numerical implementation
- A presentation covering the main aspects of the project, as shown in class
